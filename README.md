Basically a disguise plugin for minecraft.
Player disguises somewhat works?
just the skin doesn't work!
the rest should work.
if the player is already online it'll just use a persistent fake uuid that is stored in memory elsewhere it'll use the actual player disguise uuid.
Weirdly the skin update is only visible to other players.
also in tab the little player head is always black for some reason. this will probably be fixed at some point.
