Basically a disguise plugin for minecraft.
Player disguises work!
the rest should work.
if the player is already online it'll just use a persistent fake uuid that is stored in memory elsewhere it'll use the actual player disguise uuid.

This README.md can be outdated since I sometimes forget to update it but yea.
